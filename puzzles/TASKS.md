## gap_in_primes
```
The prime numbers are not regularly spaced. For example from 2 to 3 the gap is 1. From 3 to 5 the gap is 2. From 7 to 11 it is 4. Between 2 and 50 we have the following pairs of 2-gaps primes: 3-5, 5-7, 11-13, 17-19, 29-31, 41-43

A prime gap of length n is a run of n-1 consecutive composite numbers between two successive primes (see: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PrimeGaps.html).

We will write a function gap with parameters:

g (integer >= 2) which indicates the gap we are looking for

m (integer > 2) which gives the start of the search (m inclusive)

n (integer >= m) which gives the end of the search (n inclusive)

In the example above gap(2, 3, 50) will return [3, 5] or (3, 5) or {3, 5} which is the first pair between 3 and 50 with a 2-gap.

So this function should return the first pair of two prime numbers spaced with a gap of g between the limits m, n if these numbers exist otherwise `nil or null or None or Nothing (or ... depending on the language).

## digital_root

```
Digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number.

Given n, take the sum of the digits of n. If that value has more than one digit, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. The input will be a non-negative integer.

Examples:
    16  -->  1 + 6 = 7
   942  -->  9 + 4 + 2 = 15  -->  1 + 5 = 6
132189  -->  1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 8 + 9 = 24  -->  2 + 4 = 6
493193  -->  4 + 9 + 3 + 1 + 9 + 3 = 29  -->  2 + 9 = 11  -->  1 + 1 = 2

## equal_sides_of_an_array

```
You are going to be given an array of integers. Your job is to take that array and find an index N where the sum of the integers to the left of N is equal to the sum of the integers to the right of N. If there is no index that would make this happen, return -1.

For example:

Let's say you are given the array {1,2,3,4,3,2,1}:
Your function will return the index 3, because at the 3rd position of the array, the sum of left side of the index ({1,2,3}) and the sum of the right side of the index ({3,2,1}) both equal 6.

Let's look at another one.
You are given the array {1,100,50,-51,1,1}:
Your function will return the index 1, because at the 1st position of the array, the sum of left side of the index ({1}) and the sum of the right side of the index ({50,-51,1,1}) both equal 1.

Last one:
You are given the array {20,10,-80,10,10,15,35}
At index 0 the left side is {}
The right side is {10,-80,10,10,15,35}
They both are equal to 0 when added. (Empty arrays are equal to 0 in this problem)
Index 0 is the place where the left side and right side are equal.

Note: Please remember that in most programming/scripting languages the index of an array starts at 0.

Input:
An integer array of length 0 < arr < 1000. The numbers in the array can be any integer positive or negative.

Output:
The lowest index N where the side to the left of N is equal to the side to the right of N. If you do not find an index that fits these rules, then you will return -1.

Note:
If you are given an array with multiple answers, return the lowest correct index.

## sudoku_solution_validator

```
Sudoku is a game played on a 9x9 grid. The goal of the game is to fill all cells of the grid with digits from 1 to 9, so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 sub-grids (also known as blocks) contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.
(More info at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku)

Sudoku Solution Validator
Write a function validSolution/ValidateSolution/valid_solution() that accepts a 2D array representing a Sudoku board, and returns true if it is a valid solution, or false otherwise. The cells of the sudoku board may also contain 0's, which will represent empty cells. Boards containing one or more zeroes are considered to be invalid solutions.

The board is always 9 cells by 9 cells, and every cell only contains integers from 0 to 9.

## gravity_flip

```
There are some columns of toy cubes in the box arranged in a line. The i-th column contains a_i cubes. At first, the gravity in the box is pulling the cubes downwards. When Bob switches the gravity, it begins to pull all the cubes to a certain side of the box, d, which can be either 'L' or 'R' (left or right). Below is an example of what a box of cubes might look like before and after switching gravity.

+---+                                       +---+
|   |                                       |   |
+---+                                       +---+
+---++---+     +---+              +---++---++---+
|   ||   |     |   |   -->        |   ||   ||   |
+---++---+     +---+              +---++---++---+
+---++---++---++---+         +---++---++---++---+
|   ||   ||   ||   |         |   ||   ||   ||   |
+---++---++---++---+         +---++---++---++---+
Given the initial configuration of the cubes in the box, find out how many cubes are in each of the n columns after Bob switches the gravity.

Examples (input -> output:
* 'R', [3, 2, 1, 2]      ->  [1, 2, 2, 3]
* 'L', [1, 4, 5, 3, 5 ]  ->  [5, 5, 4, 3, 1]
